# better-brave-android

My recommendations for the ultimate configuration of the Brave Browser on Android :)

**NOTE:** This is specifically tailored for Brave on Android. For Desktop, see [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-brave), and for iOS, see [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-brave-ios).

**NOTE:** This project can be found on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-brave-android), which will act as the main & preferred way to contribute, and [GitHub](https://github.com/celenityy/better-brave-android).

# Brave Shields & privacy

**Block trackers & ads** -> `Block trackers & ads (Aggressive)`

**Auto-redirect AMP pages** -> ✅

**Auto-redirect tracking URLs** -> ✅

**Upgrade connections to HTTPS** -> `Require all connections to use HTTPS (strict)`

**Block Scripts** -> ✅ *(This **will** cause breakage, but it heavily improves privacy & security, so I'd recommend enabling it if possible and if you're willing to re-enable scripts on sites that need it)*

**Block Cookies** -> `Block third-party cookies` *(Should be default)*

**Block Fingerprinting** -> `Fingerprinting blocked (strict, may break sites)`

**Prevent fingerprinting via language settings** -> ✅

**Content Filtering**:

* `EasyList Cookie` -> ✅

* `Fanboy's Annoyances + uBO Annoyances` -> ✅

* `Fanboy's Social` -> ✅

* `Fanboy's Anti-Newsletter` -> ✅

* `Fanboy's Mobile Notifications` -> ✅

* `Fanboy's Anti-chat Apps` -> ✅

* `Bypass Paywalls Clean Filters` -> ✅

Don't forget to select **UPDATE** in the top right corner when you're done here.

**Forget me when I close this site** -> ✅ *(This feature drastically improves privacy, I would highly recommend using it and just setting exceptions for sites you need to stay logged in to)*

**Allow Google login buttons on third party sites** -> ❌

**Allow Facebook logins and embedded posts** -> ❌

**Allow Twitter embedded tweets** -> ❌

**Allow LinkedIn embedded posts** -> ❌

**Safe Browsing** -> `No protection (not recommended)` ❌ *(On Android, Safe Browsing requires Google Play Services and as such is proprietary and questionable. As long as you have other protection in place (See `secure DNS` & `Additional recommendations` below), then I don't think its worth using here)*

**Use secure DNS** -> ✅

Use secure DNS -> **Choose another provider** -> Pick a private, secure, & reputable DNS provider of your choice, I would recommend setting up your own [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) configuration if you are able to (See my recommendations for NextDNS [here](https://codeberg.org/Magnesium1062/nextdns-settings), otherwise I would recommend [Quad9](https://quad9.net/): `https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query` *(Even if you have a private/secure DNS provider set on your OS/network level, make sure to still set it here too like this, so that you can take advantage of [Encrypted Client Hello](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello))*

**Block cookie consent notices** -> ✅

**Block `Switch to App` Notices** -> ✅

**Close tabs on exit** -> ✅

# Additional recommendations

* Use a (reputable) VPN. I would recommend either [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/) or [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).

* Use a (reputable) anti-virus if possible, such as [Hypatia](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner/). **NOTE:** You should install Hypatia through the [DivestOS Official Repo](https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/?fingerprint=E4BE8D6ABFA4D9D4FEEF03CDDA7FF62A73FD64B75566F6DD4E5E577550BE8467) instead of F-Droid's main repo, as it will allow you to receive quicker updates directly from the developer. It's also recommended to use [F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.basic/) as your F-Droid client of choice.
